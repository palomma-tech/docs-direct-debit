### Welcome to Palomma - The Future of Payments!

At Palomma, we develop modern APIs to facilitate and automate various payment processes. Our platform enables the collection of payments and handling of payouts, along with other functionalities, tailored to meet the payment needs of different businesses in a scalable and efficient manner.

### Simplifying Transactions with Direct Debit

Our direct debit offering is a key aspect of our services. It provides a way to tokenize bank accounts, simplifying the process of collecting payments. This leads to more streamlined transactions for both businesses and their customers, enhancing the overall efficiency and ease of the payment process.

### Secure and Efficient Customer Sign-Up

Signing up customers has never been easier. Here's how it works:

1. **Collect Bank Credentials**: Gather your customer's bank account details during the sign-up process.
2. **Send to Palomma**: Forward these details securely to us.
3. **Tokenization**: We safely store this information and, in return, provide you with a unique payment token.

### Hassle-Free Future Transactions

With the generated token, you can:

- **Charge Customers Seamlessly**: Use the token for future charges without needing further interaction from your customers.
- **Ensure Security and Reliability**: Conduct transactions securely and reliably, knowing that sensitive user information is well-protected.
